                                         Hypervisor - if we used vmware ,virtual box that time enable
                                      Operating system
                                       PHYSICAL Machine

 Virtual Machine                                                 Docker Container
 - memory consumption more                                      - less
 - heighywirght                                                 - lightweight
 -   - docker is os virtaul machine
 -                                                              - Docker is create container
 -                                                              - each and every cotnainer add required images stored ex - jdk,gradle,mysql
 -   we need seprate os that time used this os (this is costly) -  if we need run install like java that time used docker container(not required used different os,vm)
 -   we need run java in different environment that time and used
 -    every one different that time
 -    use
 -    VM but heighweiht,
 -   size memeory more               -
